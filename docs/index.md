### Education

Oregon State University - B.Sc  
BioResource Research ('17)  
Concentration in Biotechnology and Genomics/Bioinformatics  
Minor in Chemistry  


### Research Data Analyst
#### OHSU Knights Diagnostics Laboratory (08/11/2022 - Present)

Use Python, R, SQL in linux to support clinical and research project needs. Provide statistical expertise and data visualization in Python and R.

### Research Assistant II  
#### OHSU Knights Diagnostics Laboratory (07/15/2019 - 08/11/2022)

Using Python, R, SQL in Ubuntu to leverage clinical, pathological, ancillary, and genomic data to support diagnostic test development, research, and data reporting at Knights Diagnostic Laboratory. Wrote a internal package named SoaPy to clean and transform clinical, pathological, ancillary, and genomic data.

### Bioinformatic Research Specialist
#### Bayer Crop Sciences (09/04/2018 - 03/29/2019)

Worked as part of a Bioinformatics Team to develop and annotate microbial genome assemblies. Collaborated with scientists to provide genomic and bioinformatic analysis on microbial genomes and genes using Perl, Python and R. Updated a chemical dereplication workflow and collaborated in its development into an in-house web application. Developed and documented relevant scripts/pipelines for genomic/bioinformatic use in Jupyter and R Markdown.

### Microbial QA/QC Technician
#### Agrinos, Inc. (10/16/2017 - 08/31/2018)

Performed quality assurance and quality control to produce high quality microbial products. Collaborated in research and development of microbial products. Developed a document and signature tracker using Microsoft Power Automate. Assisted in general lab operations and lab maintenance. Ensured the proper documentation of experiments, data, quality assurance and quality control documents.

### Laboratory and Bioinformatics Research Technician
#### Oregon State University Department of Microbiology (12/2013 - 06/10/2017)

Worked in a microbial BSL-2 laboratory to better understand *Vibrio cholerae.* Performed microbial analysis and co-culture experiments to understand predator-prey relations betweeen protozoans and *Vibrio* variants. Developed a microbial genome assembly pipeline for microbial read datasets. Developed a bioinformatic tool for the identification of conserved and non-conserved genes in microbial genoms. Wrote a program to perform buik microbial reference and SRA file download from the NCBI website.
